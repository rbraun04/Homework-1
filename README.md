My assignment was to review the html document for a company named "Horiseon" and to properly identify every "div" section to make the html more professional and presentable.  In order to do so, I exchanged many "div" sections for either main, section, or aside.  I also left notes as to the reasoning behind each section.  I also reviewed style.css and organized the .css in order of the html.  I also gave the website a title ("Horiseon).
